# Create your models here.
# User is the main table having 3 id (Primary Key), real_name and tz as columns.
# I assumed the relation between two tables is one-to-many where one record from User is 
# related to many records from ActivityPeriod since a user can have more then one session.
# I believe this is the best way to store data by preserving the relationship between models.
# The id field in User is Foreign Key to user field in ActivityPeriod.
